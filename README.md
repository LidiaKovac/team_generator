# 🍰 Vanilla HTML + JS Team Generator 🍰

### Hi students! 🖥️

This is one of the many possible solutions of today's homework. 

A note: I went with some _kind of advanced_ js logic. It's NOT technically challenging, but it could be a little hard to follow since you are just starting out. 

I added as many comments as I could, but still feel free to contact me if you have questions. 
You might also find some "unusual" syntax, like the `.filter` method. Of course I have added explanations and, where possible, alternatives you already know how to use.
