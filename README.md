# 🍰 Vanilla HTML + JS Team Generator 🍰

### Hi students! 🖥️

This is one of the many possible solutions of today's homework. 

A note: I went with some _kind of advanced_ js logic. It's NOT technically challenging, but it could be a little hard to follow since you are just starting out. 

I added as many comments as I could, but still feel free to contact me if you have questions. 

You might also find some "unusual" syntax, like the `.filter` method. Of course I have added explanations and, where possible, alternatives you already know how to use. 

As far as CSS goes, I have created some variables in the `:root` element. I'm not sure this is something you have seen before, so I have added links to MDN and W3S docs. 

I went with flexbox, but I did not use any particularly complicated selectors. I used, however pseudoclasses like `:hover` and `:disabled`

I remain available for any questions you might have, enjoy!
